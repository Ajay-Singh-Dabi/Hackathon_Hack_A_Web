Please refer to this Readme file
for the solution the main files are main_file.py, employee_faces.py, and employee_detection.py
and for the database mysql is used

**fetch the main_file.py, employee_faces.py, and employee_detection.py files and create databases first
i.e existing_database and monitoring_database and then insert your information to coonect to mySQL server
and then run employee_detection.py file**

1-First the database is created for both existing and monitoring data
2-mySQL is being used.
3-we will process the data by the use of comparison
4-we will take the live picture of the employee entering into the room and
  compare with the directors existing profile if match access granted and if not 
  we will send a warning message to d=employees and directors on their contact number
  
  if compasion fails we need to find the id of the person for that we will compare the 
  picture with existing_database

The main aim of the project is to monitor the employee from mobile app
Login Signup app created for new employees to feed their information
to the database
